# lzip_image

Lightweight docker image with lzip installed, to be used as a binary if your host doesn't have lzip installed. And you can't install it as a package for whatever reason. Or you're too lazy to use configuration management to update said host's machine image.

## Pulling the image locally

`docker pull ihamisu/lzip_image:tagname`
